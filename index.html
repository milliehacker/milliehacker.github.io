			<p>I'm a 1st-year linguistics PhD student at Michigan State University and an RA for the <a href="mi-diaries.org">MI Diaries corpus project</a>. I am interested in all things phonological variation, and compelled by the central question of how (un)markedness interfaces with the core grammar.</p>
			<p>I'm currently working on a large(ish)-scale quantitative investigation of the effects of narrative and speech rate on the emergence of non-standard features. My goal is to differentiate overlapping sources of variation and the respective roles they play in shaping outputs. The variable I'm focusing on right now is the (infamous) word-final ɪŋ/ɪn in English.</p>
			<p>I'm from the East San Francisco Bay and did my B.A. at the University of California-Santa Cruz, where I majored in Linguistics and Environmental Studies. I was an undergrad RA on a Conversation Analysis project led by Prof. Kimberly Helmer and on an LLM Social Bias project led by Profs. Pranav Anand and Allison Nguyen. I've also done some solo <a href="https://lingbuzz.net/lingbuzz/008556">theoretical work</a> on variable patterns of nasality agreement in <a href="https://pib.socioambiental.org/en/Povo:Hixkaryana">Hixkaryana</a>.</p>
			<p>Outside my academic life, I'm delightfully occupied with visual arts of all sorts (Instagram serves as my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/millies_loam_world/">informal portfolio</a>). I had the pleasure of co-coordinating Volumes 7-9 of <a href="https://fruitcakemagazine.com/">Fruitcake art magazine</a> when I was in Santa Cruz. I also love to spend time running, dancing, hiking, biking (basically anything where I get to move my legs), cooking, baking, and exchanging poetry with friends. I serve as a board member for the <a href="https://www.spartan.coop/">Spartan Housing Cooperative</a> and work on the co-op's associated <i>Pine Press</i> newspaper.
