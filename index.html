							<p>I'm a 1st-year linguistics PhD student at Michigan State University and an RA for the <a href="mi-diaries.org">MI Diaries corpus project</a>. I am interested in all things phonological variation, and compelled by the central question of how (un)markedness interfaces with the core grammar.</p>
							<p>I'm currently running a large(ish)-scale quantitative investigation of the effects of narrative and fast-speech contexts on the emergence of non-standard features. My goal is to differentiate overlapping sources of variation and the respective roles they play in shaping outputs. The variable I'm focusing on right now is the (infamous) word-final ɪŋ/ɪn in English.</p>
							<p>I'm from the East San Francisco Bay and did my B.A. at University of California-Santa Cruz, where I majored in Linguistics and Environmental Studies. During my undergrad studies, I was an RA on a Conversation Analysis project led by Prof. Kimberly Helmer and on an LLM Gender Bias project led by Profs. Pranav Anand and Allison Nguyen. In the past few years I've done intermittent <a href="https://lingbuzz.net/lingbuzz/008556">theoretical work</a> on variable patterns of nasality agreement in <a href="https://pib.socioambiental.org/en/Povo:Hixkaryana">Hixkaryana</a>.</p>
							<p>Outside my academic life, I'm infatuated with visual arts of all sorts. Instagram serves as my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/millies_loam_world/">informal portfolio</a>. I had the pleasure of co-leading Volumes 7-9 of <a href="https://fruitcakemagazine.com/">Fruitcake art magazine</a> when I was in Santa Cruz. I also love to spend time running, dancing, hiking, biking (basically anything where I get to move my legs), cooking, baking, exchanging poetry, and of course hanging out with the homies. I additionally serve as a board member for the <a href="https://www.spartan.coop/">Spartan Housing Cooperative</a> and work on the coop's associated <i>Pine Press</i> newspaper.
